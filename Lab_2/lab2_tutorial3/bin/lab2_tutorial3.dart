  // What if I want to declare 3 as double?

  // 1. specify type

  const double num1 = 3;

  // 2. convert type

  final num2 = 3.toDouble();

  // 3. specify value (as int cannot have . decimal)

  const num3 = 3.0;

  // The "as" keyword
  // as keyword is used to cast down to sub-types
  // const double db1 = 8.2;
  // final integer1 = db1 as int;

  const num db1 = 8; // you need to be sure that db1 is int for "as" to work
  final integer1 = db1 as int;

  // MINI-EXERCISES

  // Ans 1. Yes

  const age1 = 42;
  const age2 = 21;

  // Ans 2. It is double because / operator is used. It converts the answer if necessary to double. If we use ~/ instead, then averageAge would be int.

  // STRINGS IN DART
  // Strings are immuatble in dart.

  var greeting = "Hello, Dart!";

  // Dart does not offer the char data type as in other langauages.
  // We can use either single or double quotes for string literals

  const letter = "a"; // a string, and not a char
  print(letter);

  // We can Concatenate the strings just by using the (+) operator

  var message = "Hello" + " I am ";
  const name = "XYZ";
  message += name;
  print(message);

  // We can use the string buffer in case of a lot of concatenation. It is much more efficient as it creates a mutable location in the memory to add to the strings and then finally the toString() method converts it into the original immutable string.

  final greet = StringBuffer();
  greet.write("Hello");
  greet.write(" I am ");
  greet.write("XYZ");
  greet.toString();
  print(greet);

  // String interpolation offers a more organized way of dealing with strings.

  final name2 = "user";
  final sentence = "My name is $name2";
  print(sentence);

  // If the string is too large, we can use the multi-line strings.

  final mutliGreet = '''

      I'm learning Dart.
